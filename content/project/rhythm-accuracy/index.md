title: Accuracy of circadian rhythms
---

We investigated the factors that influence the ability of the internal clock in flies to synchronize with the external environment with a consistent phase of entrainment. My main project involved artificial selection on fly populations for daily emergence as adults within a window of one hour during the daytime. Another project examined the interaction between internal clock period and length of the external cycle in determining accuracy of mutant flies with different periodicities.
