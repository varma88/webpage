Fish can individually learn spatial features in their habitat but often use cues from other individuals to navigate. Here, we are examining how pairs of fish learn a spatial maze and whether the time taken to reach the reward is dependent on the extent of exploration exhibited by individual fish or the degree of coordination within the pair. We are also trying to model the sequential exploration of the maze and the use of social cues in this navigation process.
