I am a post-doctoral researcher working on Fish Behaviour and Cognition with a Ph.D on the evolution of accurate circadian rhythms. My research interests include individual variation in behavioural traits, social behaviour, behavioural plasticity and daily rhythms. I am currently developing a pipeline for tracking and analyzing the movements of multiple fish in complex and noisy environments using OpenCV, machine learning and tracking algorithms. I am also attempting to model animal behaviour and social interactions using NetLogo.
